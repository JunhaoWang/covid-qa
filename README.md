### Data summary

* **400+ pairs** collected from 15 English news websites across 4 continents.
* **600+ pairs** queried from 26 Stackexchange communities, grouped in 3 distinct categories.
* **800+ pairs** retrieved from CDC and WHO's official FAQs, available in 8 languages.
* All pairs are cleaned with regex, labelled with metadata, converted to tables, and stored in CSV files.
* Each question also includes a heuristically-sampled negative (wrong) answer. The selection process varies depending on the dataset.

In addition, we included a clean, tabular version of **290k non-COVID Q&A pairs**, queried from the same Stackexchange communities. You can [download it here](https://www.kaggle.com/xhlulu/stackexchange-qa-pairs).

### Model summary

* Electra-small and Electra-base, both trained on 500k subsample of [Healthtap Q&A pairs](https://github.com/durakkerem/Medical-Question-Answer-Datasets).
* Electra-small and Electra-base, both trained on 290k question and answer pairs from Stackexchange.
* 2 versions of Multilingual DistilBERT, trained on Healthtap and on Stackexchange, respectively.
* All the models were finetuned in `tf.keras` on Kaggle's TPUs. All the training scripts will be made available for reproducibility.

## Data Usage

To load the data, simply download the data from Kaggle or from the alternative link. Then, use pandas to load it:

```python
import pandas as pd

community = pd.read_csv("path/to/dataset/community.csv")
community.head()
```

## Model Usage

First, make sure to download the data from Kaggle or from the alternative link, and unzip the directory. Also, make sure to have the `utils` script in your current directory. For example:

```
wget https://github.com/xhlulu/covid-qa/releases/download/v1.0/electra-small-healthtap.zip
unzip electra-small-healthtap.zip
wget 
```

Then, make sure that transformers and tensorflow are correctly installed:
```
pip install transformers==2.8.0
pip install tensorflow>=2.1.0 # or pip install tensorflow-gpu>=2.1.0
```

Then, open Python and load the model using transformers:
```
import transformers as trfm

```
